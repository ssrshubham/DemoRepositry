        <h3>Birth & Childhood</h3>
       <p id="pone"> Kansh, an evil prince, imprisoned his father to usurp the throne. As a punishment, it was prophesied that his sister’s eighth child would be the reason for his downfall. On hearing this, he threw his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in a dungeon on their wedding day. The evil Kansh killed each and every child of Devaki’s. It was by God’s grace that their seventh child, Balram was saved by being taken into Rohini’s womb.
        The eighth child was born on a moonless stormy night. After the birth of the baby boy, Vasudeva realised that the gates of their prison were opened and all the guards were fast asleep. A divine voice advised Vasudeva to carry the child, Krishna, in a basket and walk into the water. As soon as Vasudeva stepped into the river, the water level of the river subsided allowing him to wade through the water to Gokula. A serpent protected Krishna from the rain with its large hood. 
        On reaching Gokula, Vasudeva left Krishna in Nanda’s house with Nanda’s wife, Yashoda. Vasudeva took Yashoda’s newborn baby girl back to the dungeon. When Kansh heard about the birth of Devaki’s eighth child, he stormed into the dungeon. He snatched the baby from them. The baby slipped and in a flash of light took the form of Goddess Durga. The Goddess broke the news to Kansh that Krishna is in safe hands and that his doom is nearing.</p>

        <h3>Putana’s failed attempt to kill Krishna</h3>
        <p id="ptwo">Kansh was in utmost distress on hearing that Devaki’s eighth child was safe. He decided to find a way to kill the baby boy and sought the help of fearful demoness named Putana. Putana was a scary-looking demoness with long hair, long nails, teeth protruding out of her mouth and blood-red tongue. Since Kansh did not know where Krishna is, he asked Putana to kill all children below the age of 10 days in his kingdom.
        Putana readily accepted the task as the killings would make people in the kingdom fear her. She then went about killing all babies around Krishna’s age. She then finally reached Krishna’s village and heard about Yashoda’s son who was believed to be special. The evil demoness realised that the child must be Krishna.
        Kansh had warned Putana that Krishna is no ordinary child and that it would not be able to kill him easily. So, she transformed herself into a beautiful maiden to deceive the villagers and Krishna’s parents. Before she went to his home, she poisoned her breasts with the venom of a deadly snake.
        On reaching Krishna’s house, she greeted everyone politely and asked Yashoda if she could feed the young boy. Unaware of the ill intentions of the disguised demoness, Yashoda allows her to feed him. Putana takes Krishna to the backyard and starts feeding him poisonous milk. She then felt like the baby was sucking the life out of her. She tried to release the baby’s mouth but Krishna had held on to her tightly. She then transformed herself into a demoness to scare the baby. Krishna did not budge. So she flew up in the air, hoping to get the boy to let go. But Krishna sucked the life out of her and she fell to the ground.
        The villagers were petrified by the scene and rushed to save Krishna. They found the little boy happily smiling and playing on the demoness’ body.</p>

        <h3>Krishna and his Love for Butter</h3>
        <p id="pthree">The village that Krishna lived in, Gokula, was a land of ‘Gopalas’ or cattle herders. So, there was an abundance of milk, curds, and butter in the village. Krishna was very fond of butter and would make use of every opportunity to steal a pot of butter from his mother or from any of the mothers in the village. All the mothers, or ‘Gopis’ as they were called, started tying pots of butter to the ceiling so that Krishna or his friends couldn’t reach them.
        Krishna would team up with his friends to reach these pots tied high up to the ceiling too. The would climb up to the roof and move the ceiling tiles to get the pot of butter or climb on each other’s shoulders to create a human ladder and steal the butter. If none of the tricks worked, they would hurl a pebble at the pot and take turns to catch the butter with their open mouths.
        The Gopis found out that Krishna was the prime culprit for stealing the butter and hence complained to his mother, Yashoda. Yashoda apologised to the women and promised to discipline Krishna. Mischievous little Krishna decided to play a prank on the Gopis. When the women had all gone to the river to bathe, he went and stole all their clothes from the bank of the river. He said he would return their clothes only if they promised that they would stop complaining to his mother.
        Yashoda heard about this and unable to discipline Krishna, tied him up to a heavy staff. Krishna couldn’t release himself so he decided to go by the river where his friends would help him. He started walking through the forest when he got stuck between two trees that were growing very close to one another. 
        Krishna simply tugged hard enough to move and ended up uprooting the trees. Yashoda ran to the site to see if her little boy was hurt but saw how he had felled two trees so easily. This incident made her realise more about Krishna’s extraordinary powers.</p>

        <h3>Krishna Miraculously Escapes</h3>
        <p id="pfour"> When Krishna was an infant, Yashoda had taken him to a village festival. After everyone had their afternoon meal, Yashoda left Krishna to sleep under a bullock cart. After a while, Krishna woke up to the noise of music. All the villagers were dancing and so Krishna also started dancing to the beats. He then accidentally hit the wheel of the bullock cart which made the cart crash to the ground.
        People darted towards the cart expecting the worst to have happened to the little boy. Astonishingly, they found the little boy still happily dancing to the tunes. Though it was one of the first incidents that proved Krishna’s celestial powers, people believed that it was a miracle that the boy was untouched by the crash.</p>

        <H3>Yashoda and the secrets about Krishna</H3>
       <p id="pfifth"> When Krishna was much younger, he sat looking at the Gopis clean all the vessels. He noticed that after a vessel in which butter was stored was emptied, the Gopis would clean them using mud. He started to wonder if even he would have to eat mud after eating butter to clean his stomach.
        So, after eating butter to his fill, he stuffed his mouth with mud. His brother, Balram, and his friends noticed that he had stuffed his mouth and asked him what it was. He refused to open his mouth so they took him to Yashoda. Yashoda also asked him to open his mouth but he did not say anything nor open his mouth. Yashoda then grabbed a stick out of anger and said he would get a beating if he didn’t open his mouth right away.
        Krishna then opened his mouth and to her surprise, Yashoda could see the entire universe clearly in Krishna’s mouth. She could even spot Gokula and herself standing in front of the child with his open mouth. In disbelief, she closed her eyes to clear her mind. When she opened her eyes she saw Krishna smiling at her innocently. Though Yashoda had taken note of this miracle, she kept it to herself as Krishna seemed unaffected.</p>

        <h3>Lord Krishna and Sudama in their Gurukul days</h3>
       <p id="psix">Lord Krishna and Sudama are now rocking on the swing and The Lord begun a conversation: “Friend, do you remember the fun we had at school in Ujjain? Then you were healthy. You have lost too much weight now. Remember the love our Guru bestowed upon us?”
        Sudama said, “Indeed! Our Guru and his wife loved and cared for us more than our parents.”
        “Sudama, do you remember the time when Gurudev’s wife sent us to bring some firewood?”
        “Leave that, it’s not worth talking about Krishna”.
        “It is Sudama! It was fun! When we were returning to school with the firewood, there was a huge storm.”
        “Yes I remember”, said Sudama quietly and sadly
        “Sudama, it rained heavily. We left the firewood on the ground and climbed a tree. I could hear your teeth making noise. When I asked you about the noise, you said that your teeth were clattering from the cold, when actually, you were eating the roasted grams given to you by Gurudev’s wife to share between the two of us! You ate it all, my share too, and lied! How funny was that!”
        Sudama was embarrassed and the queens burst out laughing. Sudama was thinking, no wonder I am deprived as I ate your share of food.
        Lord Krishna continued to say, “We sat there in the cold and rain all night. In the morning, Gurudev was annoyed at his wife for sending us for firewood so far. Gurudev then came searching for us. We were shivering with cold at the time. Gurudev brought us down from the tree, hugged us with relief, blessed us and brought us back to the hermitage”.
        “And Sudama, are you married now?”
        Sudama humorously replied, “Yes! That’s why I have lost so much weight!”
        “Great! What’s my sister-in-law’s name?”
        “Sudama shyly said, “Sushila; honestly, she is just like her name. Thanks to your grace, I have a good wife. She supports me in everything, religion, my activities and my oath of not begging.”
        “And what do you do for a living?” asked Lord Krishna.
        “I have a very busy job. I do my regular prayers three times a day and chant God’s name the rest of the day.”
        “Is that it? Then how do you feed your family?”
        “With your grace,” replied Sudama.
        Although Sudama’s children are crying of hunger and the family is struggling, Sudama did not cry his sorrows in front of God. Lord Krishna is pleased to see Sudama’s strength and spirit</p>

        <H3>Kansa Vadh: Here's why Lord Krishna Killed his Maternal Uncle</H3>
        <p id="pseven"> Kansa Vadh is celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil. On this day, Lord Krishna killed the cruel ruler of Mathura.
         Kansa Vadh is celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil. On this day, Lord Krishna killed Kansa and 'King Ugrasena'-- the ruler of India was restored his crown. The festival is observed on dashmi during Shukla Paskha in the Hindu month of Kartik or in November-- as per Gregorian calendar.
         When Kansa got to knew that Lord Krishna was the eighth child of Krishna, he made several unsuccessful attempts to kill him. He sent out demons such as Aghasura, Bakasura, Kaliye and Putana. He also planned to kill in Gokul and kill him with a mad elephant. Later, Lord Krishna killed King Kansa and released his parents from prison. King Ugrasen was restored his crown and people were freed in Mathura.
         The festival is a celebration of Dharma and Adarma. It is quite predominant in Mathura and nearby regions in Uttar Pradesh. 
         On this day, devotees worship Lord Krishna along with Radha. Special desserts and dishes are prepared to offer to the deities. An effigy of Kansa is burnt to symbolise that evil is short-lived and truth prevails in the end. People take part in the procession and recite the mantras--Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Devotees apply colors on each other as the festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm among loved ones. Several cultural events--drama, music and dance-- such as Kansa vadh leela, skit portarying take place on this day.
         As per Hindu mythology, Kansa-- brother of Krishna's mother Devaki--was a cruel and evil ruler of Mathura. He killed seven children of Devaki after he came to know that he will be killed by one of her children. He put her sister and her husband in prison. Krishna escaped death as he was exchanged with a baby girl who was killed mercilessly by Kansa. He grew up as a cattle herder to Nanda and Yashoda.</p>
